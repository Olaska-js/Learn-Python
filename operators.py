# Arithmetic Operators (+ - * /)
a = 10
b = 20
# a + b performs addition between variables a and b.
print(a + b)
# a - b performs subtraction between variables a and b.
print(a - b)
# a * b performs multiplication between variables a and b.
print(a * b)
# a / b performs division between variables a and b.
print(a / b)


# Relational Operators (< > == !=)
a = 50
b = 100
# a < b checks if a is less than b.
print(a < b)
# a > b checks if a is greater than b.
print(a > b)
# a == b checks if a is equal to b.
print(a == b)
# a != b checks if a is not equal to b.
print(a != b)


# Logical Operators (& |)
a = True
b = False
# Logical AND: Both operands need to be True for the result to be True
print(a & b)  # False
# Logical OR: At least one operand needs to be True for the result to be True
print(a | b)  # True
# Logical AND: Both operands need to be True for the result to be True
print(b & a)  # False
# Logical AND: Both operands are True, so the result is True
print(a & a)  # True
# Logical AND: Both operands are False, so the result is False
print(b & b)  # False
# Logical OR: At least one operand is True, so the result is True
print(b | a)  # True
# Logical OR: Both operands are False, so the result is False
print(b | b)  # False
# Logical OR: Both operands are True, so the result is True
print(a | a)  # True
