# Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_).
# Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are different variables.
# Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names, such as if, else, while, etc.
# Choose descriptive and meaningful names for variables to improve code readability.
